This Pok√©mon theme game features Slowpoke trapped running around the screen, dodging pokeballs. Your objective is to make sure he doesn't get captured by one of them, so avoid touching them using the arrow keys! As the game goes on, more pokeballs will fly across the screen. Your score displayed tracks how many pokeballs you were able to successfully dodge. Try to get a high score!

Summary of features:
- Slowpoke cannot run outside of the default window size
- When the pokeballs overlap Slowpoke, the game ends
